# RPS
Designed and developed a Rock, Paper, and Scissors game with multiplayer and single player options.
Developed the client-side with various HTML and  CSS techniques to make the web page appealing and friendly to use.
Used JQeury to make DOM manipulation and event handling easier.
On the server-side used JSON to send info of the computers RPS pick, so the player cannot cheat by editing the client-side
